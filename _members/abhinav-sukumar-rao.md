I am a 2018 undergrad student of BPHC majoring in computer science. My interest lies in machine learning and microprocessors. I have learnt python along with libraries such as numpy scikit-learn matplotlib keras etc, and the MERN Stack  

Projects
--------

I have made a basic bootloader which boots like a floppy disk. [Link](github.com/AetherPrior/basic_bootloader)  
I am currently working on building a c64 intro.  
I'm part of SEDS too and working on a flight computer of yet  
Here's a MERN app for Timetable making - [Link](github.com/crux-bphc/Chronofactorem)  

Skills
------

C/C++ - more than basic  
Python - more than basic  
Java - more than basic  
ASM (x86 , 6502) - hopefully more than basic  
MERN - regrettably more than basic  
Spam - demigod level
