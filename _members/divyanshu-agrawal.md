I'm currently learning various web-technologies, and learning languages and frameworks like Rust, JavaScript, Node.JS, React, Express etc. I love to make practical applications based on what I have learnt all the time, although sadly I always keep switching projects :3. Apart from programming, I like to read books, and play RTS/Strategy games like Rimworld.

## Skills

I am familiar with:

- Rust ( I'm still learning it )
- JavaScript and it's derived frameworks and libraries like React.
- Node.JS and various libraries like Express, Pug.
- MySQL, MongoDB.
- C++ & C.
